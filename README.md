# **ElateScarab.github.io: My ePortfolio**

On my GitHub pages site (ElateScarab.github.io) you will find the following items, in order:

1. Professional Self-Assessment
2. My video code review
3. My original artifact used for enhancements
4. Enhancements 1-3, their respective narratives, and a link to the artifacts

Although all three of my enhancements center around the same original artifact, I am including each enhancement as its own stage of the artifact so that my progress is visible.

### **Instructions for running enhancements 1-3 and my final project:**
Note: This project requires Python 3.1X to be installed.
1. Download the Final Artifact .zip file
2. Open the Animal Shelter Project in VS Code and select the Driver.py class
3. From the VS Code ribbon, select Run -> Run without debugging -> Default python configuration
