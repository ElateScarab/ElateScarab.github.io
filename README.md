# **ElateScarab.github.io: My ePortfolio**

On my GitHub pages site (ElateScarab.github.io) you will find the following items, in order:

1. Professional Self-Assessment
2. My video code review
3. My original artifact used for enhancements
4. Enhancements 1-3, their respective narratives, and a link to the artifact

Please note that all three of my enhancements were based on the same artifact, so rather than upload the different incomplete iterations of the artifact, I am only including the final, polished product.
