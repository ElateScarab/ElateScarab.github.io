# **About Me: (this is where my professional assessment will go)**
Welcome to my ePortfolio! My name is Thor Nielssen, and I have been enrolled at SNHU since August 2021.
This ePortfolio serves as my final project for the course.

## **My video code review:**

In this video, I review the artifacts I selected for this course and break them down.
Please note that one of these artifacts, an API, did not make it into my final project.
I instead added another enhancement category to my IT145 artifact.

## **My original artifact for enhancement:**
[Original Artifact Folder](https://github.com/ElateScarab/ElateScarab.github.io/tree/c1516d5f3db2a85e73c74df677ff26e5422fff66/Original%20Artifact/Grazioso/Grazioso/src)
This artifact came from IT145 (Foundation in Application Development), where it was originally written in Java and centered around basic array lists used to manage a rescue animal system. My enhancements for each category were applied to this artifact, to the point that the final product is nearly unrecognizable from the original. I selected this artifact because it represents my earliest work, and my enhancements show just how much I have learned at SNHU and how far I have come.

# **My final product:**
