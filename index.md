## **About Me:**
    Welcome to my ePortfolio! My name is Thor Nielssen,
    and I have been enrolled at SNHU since August 2021.
    This ePortfolio serves as my final project for the course.

## **My video code review:**

In this video, I review the artifacts I selected for this course and break them down.
Please note that one of these artifacts, an API, did not make it into my final project.
I instead added another enhancement category to my IT145 artifact.
